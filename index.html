                        <p class="about-me-text">I am 18 years old and live in Manchester. Currently, I am an apprentice at CDL (Cheshire data systems) in association with Manchester Metropolitan University on the digital and technology degree four-year course. On this course we are studying Java development, Web development and Business Systems Studying. Some notable achievements of mine are that I was part of a successful youth lacrosse team in Timperley, our team won 5 titles during our 6 seasons as a youth team. I have interests in football, as I support Manchester City Football club, and computing. In the future Iâ€™m not too sure what I want to do, but it will most likely be in the technology sphere. However, as a dream job, I would love to try and qualify to be an air traffic controller, this is a job I feel I would find thoroughly rewarding and I am interested in the aeronautics.</p>
